# Windows UWP Project

This is a school project made by me and 2 other fellow students in order to show our skills that we have developed during the classes. In this project we used C# for the front-end with UWP and a C# .Net Core Web api back-end.

**Caution: This is an unfinished project. It WILL crash and lacks some of the functionality**

## Getting Started

To run this application your require visual studio 2017, .Net Core and the UWP sdk. This can all be done with the visual studio installer.

## Deployment

This project exists out of 2 solutions:
* Front-end UWP application
* Back-end C# .Net Core Web api

After opening the project in visual studio, make sure that before you run that you have selected "Running multiple projects" in properties. Select both solutions. You can now run both front- and back-end simultaneously.
